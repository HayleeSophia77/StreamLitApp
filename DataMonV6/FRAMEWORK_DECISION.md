### Key Differences That I Discovered:

The main differences I noticed are that Flask is a full web framework while Streamlit is made for building quick data apps. Flask takes more setup and coding, but gives you a lot of control over how your app works and looks. Streamlit is much easier to use because you can make an interactive app fast without knowing HTML or CSS. Flask is better for bigger and more complex projects, while Streamlit is great for simple data apps you want to build and share quickly.

### My Choice And Why:

	I chose Streamlit because it is simple to use and perfect for quickly building data apps. I liked that I could create something interactive without having to learn extra web languages like HTML or CSS. It let me focus more on the data and results instead of spending time setting up routes or templates. Streamlit made the whole process faster and easier to understand, which is why it was the best choice for me.

### One Anticipated Challenge With Your Chosen Framework:

One challenge I might face with Streamlit is that it has limited customization and flexibility compared to other web frameworks. Since it handles most of the design and layout automatically, it can be harder to make the app look or function exactly how I want. It might also be tricky if I ever need to add advanced features or connect it to larger systems.
